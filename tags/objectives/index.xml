      <description>Several years ago, if I had been asked what I would have liked to do when I grew up, I think I would never have thought of making the list that you will see below.
I have been a developer for more than 12 years, doing Front, back, devops, big data and a period as lead developer. I am passionate about my work and I like to share with others. This thirst for sharing and mutual help made me immerse myself in associative work and communities of developers and meetups.</description>
